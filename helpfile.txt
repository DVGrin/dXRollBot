This bot allows you to roll dice in Telegram chat
To roll some dice, type in `/r` or `/roll`, followed by your formula
For example, to roll two 6-sided dice and add 5, type `/r 2d6 + 5`
You can string multiple rolls together, for example, `/r 3d6 + d8`
After the roll is performed, the bot will send the result to your chat
The bot features support for wide variety of dice mechanics
For more information on available roll types, type `/help roll`
[roll]
This bot supports different roll types. XdY rolls X dice with Y sides per die
It can perform simple rolls like `2d6 * d8`, or even math-only rolls like `5+3.7`
It supports basic arithmetic operators: `+`, `-`, `*` and `/`
In addition, you can use `%` (modulus division) and `^` or `**` (exponentiation).
You can use parentheses (`(` and `)`) to modify the order of operations
You also have access for a few mathematical functions: `floor`, `round`, `ceil` and `abs`
For more information on functions, type `/help functions`
You can also use roll modifiers to change the behaviour of dice rolls
For more information on roll modifiers, type `/help modifiers`
Note that the bot also supports Fate/Fudge dice, which have 3 sides with values `-1`, `0` and `1`
To roll *N* Fate dice, type NdF
[functions]
`floor(X)` gives you the largest integer that is less or equals to X
`ceil(X)` gives you the smallest integer that is more or equals to X
`round(X)` rounds X to the nearest whole number
`abs(X)` returns the absolute value of X
[modifiers]
You can add `khN/klN/dhN/dlN` to the roll to keep or drop N highest/lowest rolls
For more information on that, type `/help keep`
You can add `r[><=]` or `ro[><=]` to reroll some of the dice values
For more information on that, type `/help reroll`
[keep]
You can keep (or drop) a certain number of your highest/lowest rolls
To do that, add `khN/klN/dhN/dlN` after your roll
Here `k` stands for keeping N rolls while `d` stands for dropping N rolls
You can use parameter `h/l` to specify keeping highest (`h`) or lowest (`l`) rolls
You can also omit this parameter for keeping N highest rolls: `kN`
Example rolls:
`8d8k4` - roll eight d8's, keep 4 highest rolls
`10d6dl3` - roll ten d6's, drop 3 lowest rolls
[reroll]
You can reroll dice values of your choosing
To do that, add `r=N/r<N/r>N` after your roll
This will reroll any dice that are equal, less or more that N, respectively
By default dice will reroll until all dice are within the specified parameters
You can specify an optional parameter `o` which tells to reroll each die only once regardless of outcome
Example rolls:
`6d6r1` - roll six d6's, reroll any time a 1 is rolled
`10d8r>5` - roll ten d8's, reroll any time 6 or higher is rolled
`4d7ro<3` - roll four d7's, reroll anything less than 3 once
